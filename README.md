# LinuxSetup
My personal Linux configuration and setup tools

Run the `environment-setup.sh` script **without sudo**

Additional optional steps:
* Copy the `.bash_aliases` file to `~/`
* In vscode, open the command palette with ctrl+shift+p and select "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)". Copy and paste the contents of `vscode/user_settings.json` in this repo into the vscode user settings JSON file
